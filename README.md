# Algorithm 

## Today I started this challenge, In which I want to develop my part of algorithms 

For this project I use Python as language of Programming. 
	Is Python a programming language? What happened here? It's stupid you did here.
	I this challenge I want to show everyone who has this idea about Python 

I follow this course on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-bootcamp-in-python/)
